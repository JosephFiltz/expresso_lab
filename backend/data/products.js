      'When we released Apollo in the summer of 2010, the goal was to create a blend using the best possible coffees of the moment. It was a radical idea for its time\u2014a coffee blend not focused on tasting the same all the time\u2014and pretty quickly washed coffees from Ethiopia became the anchoring component, due in large part to their consistently superior quality. \n\nEventually, we made the choice to transition Apollo to 100% certified organic washed Ethiopian coffees, officially making Ethiopia the headline instead of the detail. Apollo is a year-round celebration of the birthplace of coffee and it\u2019s bright, floral, and silky coffees. Specific lots will change with the seasons, but the thing that will never change is the complexity of the coffee. \n',

Sourcing clean and low-acidity coffees from smallholder producers isn\u2019t an easy task. The coffees in Big Trouble come from many of the same partners that produce our Single Origin offerings and we take great care to maintain just the right blend to create a coffee with sweet notes of caramel, nut, and dark chocolate.\n\nAn extremely versatile coffee, Big Trouble can shine in any brew method\u2014and is a wonderful partner to milk-based beverages as espresso.\n',

      "We first tasted coffee from Cinco de Junio in 2009, when a graduate student working with the Fabretto Children\u2019s Foundation sent us an unexpectedly delicious sample from one of the producers in the co-op. That producer's coffee would go on to take second place in the 2010 Cup of Excellence Nicaragua! We visited Las Sabanas for the first time in October of that year and have worked closely with the leadership of the co-op ever since.\n\nDuring the 2012\u20132013 harvest season, a combination of factors led to the outbreak of a fungus called Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR) that devastated farms throughout Central America. The producers of the Cinco de Junio cooperative were hit hard, with both their yields and quality plummeting. We continued to support the cooperative, with all of the coffee we purchased going into year-round products such as Big Trouble, Forty Six, and Fast Forward. In addition, Cinco de Junio initiated multiple projects funded by our Seeds grant program to help its members upgrade their farms and wet mills. Year after year, the co-op has maximized the scant resources available to them, never losing sight of their desire to produce some of the highest quality, organically grown coffee in the country. \n\nSince the 2018-2019 harvest season, Cinco de Junio has employed a talented cupper to taste members' coffee deliveries to the cooperative. This enables individualized feedback to each member and combining deliveries into larger lots depending on cup quality. This type of support has been a game-changer for the co-op. In recent years, we\u2019ve tasted some of the best coffees from the group since the CLR crisis hit. We're thrilled to see their persistence and hard work pay off, resulting in the return of a coffee that has historically been a staple of our Single-Origin lineup.",

      "We were first introduced to farmers in Nari\u00f1o in 2012 through the Borderlands project initiated by Catholic Relief Services. In our first tastings of different coffees from the region, it was coffee from farms in La Florida that attracted our attention. The producers of these coffee went on to found the ASPROCAES association, which today counts 164 members. Counter Culture has purchased coffees from the association since 2012 and recently funded a Seeds grant to establish a community nursery of coffee and shade trees.\n\nUrcunina is the name Quillasingas Indians gave to what is also known as the Galeras volcano, a prominent landmark in La Florida. The word translates to \"Monta\u00f1a de Fuego'' or \u201cfire mountain.\u201d The farmers in ASPROCAES chose Urcunina as a brand for their coffee in order to distinguish it from other coffees in the region. \n\nThis coffee was decaffeinated at DESCAFECOL, the first and only decaffeination plant in Colombia. DESCAFECOL uses ethyl acetate, a derivative of sugarcane, during the decaffeination process. It results in a delightfully sweet coffee, perhaps owing, in part, to the sugar used during the process. Decaf coffee drinkers are the true coffee lovers\u2013\u2013here for the flavor, not for the kick\u2013\u2013and we hope you enjoy it. ",

      'Finca El Puente is owned by Marysabel Caballero and her husband, Mois\u00e9s Herrera. Marysabel is a third-generation coffee farmer. Her maternal grandfather, Felipe Garc\u00eda, established coffee farms and passed them down to his daughter, Sandra, who shares ownership with her husband, Fabio. Mois\u00e9s grew up in Guatemala and trained as an accountant. After school, he worked for a Guatemalan coffee company, but his curious nature pushed him to look beyond the books and learn multiple facets of the business. Recognizing his cross-functional value, the company sent him to Honduras in the 1990s to manage their coffee operations and this eventually led him to invest in some land in Chenacla. Shortly after, he married Marysabel and they established the land as a coffee farm, together. They dedicated themselves to producing the highest-quality coffee they could, and when they heard about the first coffee quality contests in Honduras, they entered their lots. Right away, their coffee started to win prizes, and coffee from Finca El Puente began an impressive winning streak that continues to the present day.\n\nToday, Finca El Puente is one of the most innovative farms in the world, growing exotic coffee varieties under unique conditions, testing experimental processing techniques, and generally pushing every aspect of coffee production to improve the coffee and the farm itself. They push their potential as employers as well, employing farm workers year-round, making improvements in housing, and investing in schools for their employees and greater community. \n',

      'Colombia is the second-largest producer of Arabica coffee and third-largest producer of coffee in the world.

      'For Perennial, we combine two roasts of coffee from Finca La Victoria\u2014a blend of a lighter and a darker roast from Nicaragua. This approach brings juicy raisin notes, sweet dark chocolate flavors, and a heavier mouthfeel to the cup. \n\nFinca La Victoria sits nestled in the quiet pine forests of Dipilto, Nicaragua\u2014a community widely known for producing some of the best coffees in the country. Year after year, the Lovo family works with their dedicated staff to refine their systems, from farm health to fermentation techniques, pushing to increase the quality of their production. \n\nFinca La Victoria was first planted with coffee in 1872. Over time, most of the coffee produced there made its way into regional blends after being sold to nearby large estates. Mario Martin Lovo and his wife, Nelly, purchased the farm in 2007, not knowing at the time that it had once belonged to his great grandmother, Helena. Since then, the Lovos bought smaller nearby parcels, increasing the size of the farm to nearly 60 hectares. Along with growing the size of the farm, the Lovos have made steady improvements and renovations over the years. Most recently, they invested in modernizing their pulping and processing equipment, which has not only helped to add more complexity to the flavor of their coffee, but does so using less water than traditional methods.',
